"""
During the development of the package I realised that there is a typing
inconsistency. The input components of a Wide and Deep model are of type
nn.Module. These change type internally to nn.Sequential. While nn.Sequential
is an instance of nn.Module the oppossite is, of course, not true. This does
not affect any funcionality of the package, but it is something that needs
fixing. However, while fixing is simple (simply define new attributes that
are the nn.Sequential objects), its implications are quite wide within the
package (involves changing a number of tests and tutorials). Therefore, I
will introduce that fix when I do a major release. For now, we live with it.

class WideDeep(nn.Module):
    r"""Main collector class that combines all ``wide``, ``deeptabular``
    (which can be a number of architectures), ``deeptext`` and
    ``deepimage`` models.

    There are two options to combine these models that correspond to the
    two main architectures that ``pytorch-widedeep`` can build.

        - Directly connecting the output of the model components to an ouput neuron(s).

        - Adding a `Fully-Connected Head` (FC-Head) on top of the deep models.
          This FC-Head will combine the output form the ``deeptabular``, ``deeptext`` and
          ``deepimage`` and will be then connected to the output neuron(s).

    Parameters
    ----------
    wide: ``nn.Module``, Optional, default = None
        ``Wide`` model. I recommend using the ``Wide`` class in this
        package. However, it is possible to use a custom model as long as
        is consistent with the required architecture, see
        :class:`pytorch_widedeep.models.wide.Wide`
    deeptabular: ``nn.Module``, Optional, default = None
        currently ``pytorch-widedeep`` implements a number of possible
        architectures for the ``deeptabular`` component. See the documenation
        of the package. I recommend using the ``deeptabular`` components in
        this package. However, it is possible to use a custom model as long
        as is  consistent with the required architecture.
    deeptext: ``nn.Module``, Optional, default = None
        Model for the text input. Must be an object of class ``DeepText``
        or a custom model as long as is consistent with the required
        architecture. See
        :class:`pytorch_widedeep.models.deep_text.DeepText`
    deepimage: ``nn.Module``, Optional, default = None
        Model for the images input. Must be an object of class
        ``DeepImage`` or a custom model as long as is consistent with the
        required architecture. See
        :class:`pytorch_widedeep.models.deep_image.DeepImage`
    deephead: ``nn.Module``, Optional, default = None
        Custom model by the user that will receive the outtput of the deep
        component. Typically a FC-Head (MLP)
    head_hidden_dims: List, Optional, default = None
        Alternatively, the ``head_hidden_dims`` param can be used to
        specify the sizes of the stacked dense layers in the fc-head e.g:
        ``[128, 64]``. Use ``deephead`` or ``head_hidden_dims``, but not
        both.
    head_dropout: float, default = 0.1
        If ``head_hidden_dims`` is not None, dropout between the layers in
        ``head_hidden_dims``
    head_activation: str, default = "relu"
        If ``head_hidden_dims`` is not None, activation function of the head
        layers. One of ``tanh``, ``relu``, ``gelu`` or ``leaky_relu``
    head_batchnorm: bool, default = False
        If ``head_hidden_dims`` is not None, specifies if batch
        normalizatin should be included in the head layers
    head_batchnorm_last: bool, default = False
        If ``head_hidden_dims`` is not None, boolean indicating whether or
        not to apply batch normalization to the last of the dense layers
    head_linear_first: bool, default = False
        If ``head_hidden_dims`` is not None, boolean indicating whether
        the order of the operations in the dense layer. If ``True``:
        ``[LIN -> ACT -> BN -> DP]``. If ``False``: ``[BN -> DP -> LIN ->
        ACT]``
    pred_dim: int, default = 1
        Size of the final wide and deep output layer containing the
        predictions. `1` for regression and binary classification or number
        of classes for multiclass classification.

    Examples
    --------

    >>> from pytorch_widedeep.models import TabResnet, DeepImage, DeepText, Wide, WideDeep
    >>> embed_input = [(u, i, j) for u, i, j in zip(["a", "b", "c"][:4], [4] * 3, [8] * 3)]
    >>> column_idx = {k: v for v, k in enumerate(["a", "b", "c"])}
    >>> wide = Wide(10, 1)
    >>> deeptabular = TabResnet(blocks_dims=[8, 4], column_idx=column_idx, embed_input=embed_input)
    >>> deeptext = DeepText(vocab_size=10, embed_dim=4, padding_idx=0)
    >>> deepimage = DeepImage(pretrained=False)
    >>> model = WideDeep(wide=wide, deeptabular=deeptabular, deeptext=deeptext, deepimage=deepimage)


    .. note:: While I recommend using the ``wide`` and ``deeptabular`` components
        within this package when building the corresponding model components,
        it is very likely that the user will want to use custom text and image
        models. That is perfectly possible. Simply, build them and pass them
        as the corresponding parameters. Note that the custom models MUST
        return a last layer of activations (i.e. not the final prediction) so
        that  these activations are collected by ``WideDeep`` and combined
        accordingly. In addition, the models MUST also contain an attribute
        ``output_dim`` with the size of these last layers of activations. See
        for example :class:`pytorch_widedeep.models.tab_mlp.TabMlp`
